    """
    Represents when the client has successfully connected.

    ---

    The `READY` event can be the largest and most complex one
    the Gateway will send, as it contains all the state required
    for a client to begin interacting with the rest of the platform.

    v : `int`
        The used version of the Discord API.
    user_settings : `dict`, optional

    guilds : `list[UnavailableGuild]`
        The guilds unavailable to the bot.
    geo_ordered_rtc_regions : `list[str]`
        The RTC voice regions accessible to the bot application.
    session_type : `str`
        The type of session that the bot has established with the Gateway.
    session_id : `str`
        The ID of the bot's Gateway connection session, used for reconnection.
    resume_gateway_url : `str`
        The URL of the Gateway upon resuming an existing connection.
    shard : `list[int]`, optional
        The shards of the Gateway connection, if present.

    - The client could not identify itself correctly.
    - The Gateway has invalidated the session for you, and requires a new connection.
